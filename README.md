# Car_Price_Prediction


Car price prediction using a machine learning model is a common data science task. It involves building a predictive model to estimate the price of a car based on various features and attributes. Here is a high-level summary of the steps involved in creating a car price prediction model using machine learning:

**1. Data Collection:**

Gather a dataset containing information about various car models, including features like  model, year, fuel, seller type,transmission etc.
The dataset should also include the actual prices of these cars.

**2. Data Preprocessing:**

Handle missing data by imputing or removing rows with missing values.
Encode categorical variables, such as make, model, and fuel type, into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

**3. Data Splitting:**

Split the dataset into two subsets: a training set and a testing set. Typically, 70-80% of the data is used for training, and the remaining 20-30% is used for testing.

**4. Model Selection:**

Choose a machine learning algorithm suitable for regression tasks. Common choices include linear regression, random forest etc.,
You can start with a simple model like linear regression and gradually experiment with more complex models to find the one that provides the best predictive performance.


**5. Model Training:**

Train the selected machine learning model on the training dataset. The model learns the relationships between the car features and their prices.


**6. Model Evaluation:**

Evaluate the model's performance on the testing dataset using appropriate regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Visualize the model's predictions against the actual prices to assess how well the model is performing.

**7. Hyperparameter Tuning:**

Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to improve its predictive accuracy. This may involve adjusting parameters like learning rate, depth of decision trees, or the number of hidden layers in a neural network.

**8. Feature Selection:**

Analyze the importance of each feature in predicting car prices. You can use techniques like feature importance scores or recursive feature elimination to identify the most significant features.
